# Trello Workflow Overview

## Purpose
This project was tracked using a Trello board to simulate a real QA workflow and demonstrate task tracking, test execution management, and defect logging.

-----

## Board Structure
The Trello board was organised into the following lists:
- Project Info
- To Do – Test Design
- Ready for Execution
- In Progress – Testing
- Bugs Found
- Retest / Regression
- Done

-----

## Workflow Summary
- Test planning and test case creation tasks were tracked from “To Do” to “Done”.
- Test execution was managed using limited work-in-progress to reflect realistic QA practices.
- Defects were logged as individual cards with steps to reproduce, severity, and supporting screenshots.
- Completed testing activities were moved to “Done” to provide clear visibility of project progress.

-----

## Outcome
The Trello board provided a clear and structured way to manage the full test cycle and ensured all test activities and defects were documented and traceable.
